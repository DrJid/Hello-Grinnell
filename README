Hello Grinnell! :)

If this shows up! then i've learnt something incredible!! 

I'm editing this read me from a macbook pro. Whatcha gonna do??? 

This is pushing from Source Tree. 

And now that the host file has changed. Will Source Tree realise this? 

Is this modifying it on the branch? Which then makes branches local right? 
Yeah.. i think soâ€¦ 

Dual changes on the same document. 

Edited from the terminal
